    <h1>Dominoes Engine Project</h1>
    <h2><a href="https://github.com/AidanIbrahim/Dominoes-AI-Project"> Github Reposository</a></h2>
    <h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>Dominoes is a very prevalent game in my culture, which inspired me to want to see if I could create an AI model to play 2 Player dominoes. 
    In Puerto Rico, Dominoes is a very popular pastime. I have fond memories of playing with my Mother and Abuela. Despite being a simple game, there is lots of strategy and 
    deduction involved higher level play, which spurred my interest in creating an AI player to try and develop stratagies.</p>
    <h3>Rules:</h3>
    <p>Dominoes is a popular game across the Carribean as well as in other Latin Countries, with many regional variations. I will quickly detail the rules I used, but if you want a
        more comprehensive overview, <a href="https://www.dominorules.com/straight-dominoes">click here.</a> At the beginning of the game each player draws 7 dominoes, the player
        with the highest value double goes first. If neither player has a double, the player with the most valueble domino goes first. Players then alternate placing dominoes on
        one of the two sides, playing a domino with a matching suit. If a player cannot play, they must draw dominoes until they can, or pass if there are no dominoes left to 
        draw. The first player to empty their hand wins, earns points equal to the total value of other players remaining dominoes. There are some special ways to win, namely 
        a Chuchazo, where the winning domino is a double blank, or the Capic√∫ where the winning domino can be played on either ends and is not a Double. These both award 100
        bonus points.

    <p>This Spreadsheet demonstrates the win rates in matches between the different AI models I developed. I started with a random opponent as a baseline, then developed more 
        stratagies ranging from simple to more complex.
    </p>
    <h3>Models:</h3>
    <h4>Random:</h4>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> This agent simply plays a random legal move, this is what I used as a baseline to measure agent performance.</p>
    <h4>HighestFirst</h4>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> This agent weights moves based on the value of the dominoes in hand. Higher values ones are preferable as it will give less points
        to the opponent on a loss. Was about the same or slightly worse than random.
    </p>
    <h4>CommonSuit</h4>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> This agent scores moves based on amount of dominoes with matching suits after it is played. The first "rational agent".</p>
    <h4>CommonSuitV2</h4>
    <p style="text-indent: 25px;"> A massive improvement over the first version, this model has many parameters to weigh potential moves such as matches, 
        if the opponent has passed on a suit recently, if the move is a force play, or if the domino is a double blank. Currently my strongest model.
